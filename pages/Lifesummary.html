      <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
      <p class="alignText">
        I was born May 25th, 2000 in a small town in Kansas called Salina. I had
        lived there for 10 years until moving to Stockton, California where I
        currently reside. As a young kid, I was wild and quite boisterous. With
        no sense of conscious I literally did whatever I wanted. My life at this
        point consisted of playing out side with friends, and playing Halo on my
        Xbox.
      </p>
      <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
      <p class="alignText">
        After moving to California I had develop a little more personality for
        myself. I become more conscious of my actions and what I say. I kinda
        became more preserved and introverted. That didn't stop me though, I
        still made plenty of friends in middle school and I consider 8th grade
        the most fun year in my schooling.
      </p>
      <p class="alignText">
        Highschool was pretty chill. I didn't really do much in my classes. I
        would just show up and listen to music, hang out with friends, and be a
        poor student. Most of my time was spent playing video games. League of
        Legends, Cod, GTA, its all I would do after school. Surprisingly I
        graduated with a 2.4 GPA and I was headed off to college.
      </p>
      <h2>Present Day</h2>
      <p class="alignText">
        Yeah collage didn't last long. I spent a year and a half at community
        collage and it was not a good time. I was broke, my grades where bad,
        and all I did was play League of Legends. I decided to drop out and pick
        up a job at an Amazon warehouse. I actually had a decent time there. I
        had worked there for a year and met plenty of cool people. I actually
        took up a leadership position there and I was able to further developt
        my social skills.
      </p>
      <p class="alignText">
        But all good things come to an end and I got tired of working there. I
        decided to quit and move on to a different job. At this point I was 21
        and I didn't have any plans. Work, work, work, that's all I did.
      </p>
      <p class="alignText">
        I spent almost two years at my last job, but quit because I got tired of
        the monotony. Doing the same thing over and over again sucked, I wanted
        more from my life. During my time there, I heard from a family friend
        that there was a coding program in Stockton that I could join and pursue
        a career in. I thought it over for a year and finally decided that I had
        enough! I wanted to atleast do something different, so I decided to join
        this program! So here I am at 24, taking this class. Hopefully I can
        stay commited and not get kicked out!
